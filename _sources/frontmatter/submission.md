# Challenge Submission Instructions

When you complete a Challenge, you should submit it to the instructor. This page contains instructions to help you submit your assignment so you can get feedback. (Remember that the Exercises in this course do not have a required submission.)

**Note**: In order to export a jupyter notebook to a PDF, you will need to have a latex installation. See [this website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) for instructions on installing latex across different operating systems (Linux, Mac OS, and Windows).

## 1. Complete the assignment

To the best of your ability, complete the Challenge that you aim to submit.

## 2. Re-run the notebook

Once you've completed the Challenge and are ready to submit, make sure to first *re-run* the entire notebook. This helps ensure your work is free of errors. You can re-run a notebook by clicking `Kernel > Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...` (as pictured below).

## 3. Export the notebook to pdf

```{admonition} Make sure to install latex first!
Before you can run the following step, you will need to make sure you have a latex install. See [this website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) for help.
```

Once you have re-run the notebook, you can export it to a PDF document. This makes it easier for us to read your work (and is generally a useful way to share Jupyter notebooks!). You can export to PDF by clicking `File > Export Notebook As... > PDF` (as pictured below).

Please reach out (via email) if you have trouble with any of these steps!
